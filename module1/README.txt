First Module allowed me to know about:
1. Launching browser with Selenium WebDriver
2. Setting up the Selenium WebDriver environment
3. Methods for finding items in Selenium WebDriver
4. Finding elements on an HTML page

During this module I had created small projects (you can find tasks inside each file)
